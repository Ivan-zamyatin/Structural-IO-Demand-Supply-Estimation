# Structural-IO-Demand-Supply-Estimation
A comprehensive Python-based study of EIO. This project implements structural models to estimate demand (using BLP and Nested Logit with instrumental variables) and supply-side dynamics (estimating via the Olley-Pakes algorithm with firm exit correction). It demonstrates advanced skills in correcting for endogeneity, selection bias, simultaneity.
